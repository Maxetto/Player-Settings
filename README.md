# Lobby-PlayerPreferences
This is the official source code of the plugin Lobby&PlayerPreferences.

Lobby&PlayerPreferences supports 1.7.X and 1.8.X. The plugin adds a very cool and configurable menu to your server's lobby/hub

This plugin only works with spigot, if you try it with craftbukkit it may not work!

With these menus, you can change the preferences that you want, like fly, hub stacker, and many others

This menu is one of the most searched menus, that is the reason why I made this plugin, Also the plugin is free, you can check it out on the spigot page

Where can I check out this cool plugin? Right here! Plugin Page: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/lobby-player-preferences.14622/
